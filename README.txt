Project description:
MetaTweet is a web application that tacks two of the issues mentioned in Cory Doctorow's "Metacrap", namely "people are lazy" and "people are stupid"--it helps twitter user look for hashtags and images that are relevant to his/her tweet. In addition, the layout is responsive, i.e. it is optimized for different types of displays (desktop, tablet horizontal/vertical, & mobile).

User flow: after writing the tweet, the user would highlight a word/phrase that s/he would like to search and click the "search" link. The app will crawl Twitter and Flickr to find relevant tags and images. The user can then add the tag(s) and/or image(s) that s/he deems relevant to the tweet. Once the user is done, s/he would click "post" and the tweet will be posted on his/her Twitter account.

Re: workflow, in the beginning, we mostly worked in parallel--while Kate & Max focused on the back-end functionalities, Raymon built the front-end components. Around the middle of the timeline, we integrated the components and got a taste of how the app functions. Afterward, we kept on refining the details and worked on functionality issues. 

Technologies used on the project:
- HTML
- CSS
- javascript & jQuery
- JSON
- Flickr & Twitter API
- Python
